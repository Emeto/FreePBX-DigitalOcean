# FreePBX for DigitalOcean
FreePBX is a web-based open source GUI (graphical user interface) that controls and manages Asterisk (PBX), an open source communication server.

This read-me contains information about a FreePBX image I generated for use inside DigitalOcean or other cloud service provider that supports custom images initialized via cloud-init. It has to be noted that since this is a VDI file, it can also be used by any virtualization software that supports the VDI format.
